#Interactive Object Detection System

This project is an interactive **Computer Vision application** that allows users to **upload an image** and automatically detects multiple objects present in the image using a **pretrained YOLOv8 deep learning model**.

The system provides visual output in the form of **bounding boxes, object labels, and confidence scores**, making it easy to understand and interpret the model’s predictions

##  Features
- Upload image through a simple web interface
- Detect multiple objects in a single image
- Draw bounding boxes with object names
- Uses pretrained deep learning model
- No dataset training required
- Fast and accurate predictions

## Technology Stack

- **Python**
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**
- **Streamlit** – for web-based UI
- **OpenCV**
- **Pillow (PIL)**
- **NumPy**
